NGP Orchestration using vagrant and virtualbox
=================
Vagrant setup to spin up control plane VMS for NGP 

Dependencies
----------------
Ensure that the following software is installed 

1. virtualbox:(5 or later) https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. vagrant:(1.8.1 or later)    https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html


Install the ngp-vagrant package
----------------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/itsmaverick/ngp-vagrant
```

Add your Gateway IP 
------------------------
Add your gateway IP address. The default gateway is router created by VirtualBox for VMs:
```sh
sudo ip route add default via 10.0.2.2
```
Change this ip if required in provision/ubuntuhostsetup.sh


Create Virtual BOX instances
------------------------
To create Virtualbox instances , use the following command:
```sh
vagrant up
```
This creates a dev VM, and three host VMS, with right version of docker, git installed, and Docker files are configured appropriately to accept commands from controlplane.

Ensure right NIC interface is selected when prompted for each host.

```sh
==> host2: Available bridged network interfaces:
1) em1
2) vmnet1
5) vmnet8
==> host2: When choosing an interface, it is usually the one that is
==> host2: being used to connect to the internet.
    host2: Which interface should the network bridge to? 1
```


```sh
[sada@sada-1x ngp-vagrant]$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

dev                       running (virtualbox)
host1                     running (virtualbox)
host2                     running (virtualbox)
host3                     running (virtualbox)

```

Accessing the hosts
------------------------
Default username and password for these VMS is vagrant:vagrant. VMs can be accessed using the following.

```sh
vagrant ssh host1
ssh vagrant@[host1 ip]
```
Ensure hostname -i returns the ipaddress not some 127.0.0.0 address. if it does fix it by adding the ipaddress in 

```sh
/etc/hosts file
10.32.1.109 host1 host1
```

Note down the IPAddresses of host1, host2, host3 eth1 NIC


Dev machine setup
------------------------
Use dev host to download the ngp-controlplane code and invoke the cloud script.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Infoblox-CTO/ngp-orchestration.git
```

Build the Code
------------------------
run make command in ngp dir

```sh
make
```

Deploy the CP on all hosts
------------------------
run the cloud command to deploy CP on all hosts
cgroup is the folder in which cgroup is installed on the hosts, mostly it is /cgroup or /sys/fs/cgroup
```sh
cloud/cloud --log [string] dc create --space 192.0.0.0/12 -network 192.2.0.0/16 
cloud/cloud --log [string] dc -u [username] -p [password] attach <HOST1 IP> <HOST2 IP> <HOST3 IP>
```
NOTE that you need a credentials to run "cloud dc attach" command.

For EPAM developers: you should change the first command due to conflict with EPAM network
```sh
cloud/cloud --log [string] dc create --space 192.168.0.0/16 --network 192.168.0.0/12 
```

Test Consul
------------------------
run the following commands to test consul

```sh
curl -i http://[Host ip]:8500/v1/catalog/nodes -X GET
```

Test Marathon
------------------------
run the following commands to test if marathon is properly deployed

```sh
curl -i http://[Host1 ip]:8080/v2/info -X POST 
```

What did we do untill now ?
------------------------
we installed, 3 servers with CP infrastructure as shown in this image.

Deploy sample application on CP
------------------------
run the following commands to deploy sample applications

```sh
curl -i http://[Host1 ip]:8080/v2/apps -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@/vagrant/ubuntu.json
```

Destroy the setup
------------------------
To destroy deployed resources
```sh
//destroy all hosts
vagrant destroy 
//destroy a host
vagrant destroy host1
```
